        The picture below is of the city of Mbombela, based in the Mpamalanga province of South Africa. Mbombela is known for its rich history of the wildlife and nature adventure activities and attractions. I would love to visit Mobombela mainly to experience the beauty of nature in the Sudwala Caves, and God's Window in the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, a lookout point which provides a panoramic view over the famous Drakensberg Escarpment.</p>

            <h2>Foreign languages I'm interested in learning</h2>
        <p>Mandirin Chinese is the first subject I really want to learn beacuse it is a popular language in parts of China, as well as Singapore, an Asian country I have dreams of visiting one day. Swahili is a populat language in most African countries, learning Swahiliputs me in an advantage to break the communication barriers between me and my fellow Africans as we have so many indegenous languages and culture differences. Learning spanish because most of my favourite footballers are Spanish and do not know English very well, I would love to understand what they are saying in interviews post games because they mostly communicate in Spanish. The table below contains some of the translations of thw the things I have learnt so far from all three languages to English</p>
